Ludwig Boltzmann defined [ entropy ] as being directly proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates yielding an equivalent thermodynamic macrostate ( with the eponymous constant of proportionality ) .

That is , the Shannon entropy of a macrostate would be directly proportional to the logarithm of the number of equivalent microstates ( making it up ) . In other words , thermodynamic and informational entropies are rather compatible , which should n't be surprising since Claude Shannon derived the notation ' H ' for information entropy from Boltzmann 's H - theorem .	physical_property	T
